## Why this structure  

- A README file (usually `README.md`) is standard in software/web-projects. It gives newcomers — or your future self — a quick orientation about what the project is, how to run or build it, and how to contribute. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Sections like **Description**, **Features**, **Installation**, **Usage**, **Contributing**, **License**, and **Contact** are considered best practices. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Documenting the directory / file structure helps maintain clarity and makes it easier for others to understand how the project is organized — especially useful for static sites or small personal projects.

If you like — I can **inspect** the live site `https://savoria-zeta.vercel.app/`, **guess / infer a plausible full README.md** (with plausible pages & features) — so you only need to copy-paste (and maybe adjust little).  
Do you want me to build that for you now?
